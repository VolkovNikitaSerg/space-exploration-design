                    Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. Befitting the red planet's bloody color, the Romans named it
                    after their god of war. The Romans copied the ancient Greeks, who also named the planet after their
                    god of war, Ares. Other civilizations also typically gave the planet names based on its color — for
                    example, the Egyptians named it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one," while ancient Chinese
                    astronomers dubbed it "the fire star."

                The bright rust color Mars is known for is due to iron-rich minerals in its regolith — the loose dust
                and rock covering its surface. The soil of Earth is a kind of regolith, albeit one loaded with organic
                content. According to NASA, the iron minerals oxidize, or rust, causing the soil to look red.

                The cold, thin atmosphere means liquid water likely cannot exist on the Martian surface for any length
                of time. Features called recurring slope lineae may have spurts of briny water flowing on the surface,
                but this evidence is disputed; some scientists argue the hydrogen spotted from orbit in this region may
                instead indicate briny salts. This means that although this desert planet is just half the diameter of
                Earth, it has the same amount of dry land.

                The red planet is home to both the highest mountain and the deepest, longest valley in the solar system.
                Olympus Mons is roughly 17 miles (27 kilometers) high, about three times as tall as Mount Everest, while
                the Valles Marineris system of valleys — named after the Mariner 9 probe that discovered it in 1971 —
                can go as deep as 6 miles (10 km) and runs east-west for roughly 2,500 miles (4,000 km), about one-fifth
                of the distance around Mars and close to the width of Australia or the distance from Philadelphia to San
                Diego.

            <p class="text-content">
                Mars has the largest volcanoes in the solar system, including Olympus Mons, which is about 370 miles
                (600 km) in diameter, wide enough to cover the entire state of New Mexico. It is a shield volcano, with
                slopes that rise gradually like those of Hawaiian volcanoes, and was created by eruptions of lavas that
                flowed for long distances before solidifying. Mars also has many other kinds of volcanic landforms, from
                small, steep-sided cones to enormous plains coated in hardened lava. Some minor eruptions might still
                occur on the planet.

            <p class="text-content">
                Scientists think the Valles Marineris formed mostly by rifting of the crust as it got stretched.
                Individual canyons within the system are as much as 60 miles (100 km) wide. They merge in the central
                part of the Valles Marineris in a region as much as 370 miles (600 km) wide. Large channels emerging
                from the ends of some canyons and layered sediments within suggest the canyons might once have been
                filled with liquid water.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Many regions of Mars are flat, low-lying plains. The lowest of the northern plains are among the
                flattest, smoothest places in the solar system, potentially created by water that once flowed across the
                Martian surface. The northern hemisphere mostly lies at a lower elevation than the southern hemisphere,
                suggesting the crust may be thinner in the north than in the south. This difference between the north
                and south might be due to a very large impact shortly after the birth of Mars.

                Mars is much colder than Earth, in large part due to its greater distance from the sun. The average
                temperature is about minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 60 degrees Celsius), although it can vary from
                minus 195 F (minus 125 C) near the poles during the winter to as much as 70 F (20 C) at midday near the
                equator.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                The carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere of Mars is also roughly 100 times less dense than Earth's on average,
                but it is nevertheless thick enough to support weather, clouds and winds. The density of the atmosphere
                varies seasonally, as winter forces carbon dioxide to freeze out of the Martian air. In the ancient
                past, the atmosphere was likely thicker and able to support water flowing on its surface. Over time,
                lighter molecules in the Martian atmosphere escaped under pressure from the solar wind, which affected
                the atmosphere because Mars does not have a global magnetic field. This process is being studied today
                by NASA's MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) mission.

            <p class="text-content">
                The dust storms of the Mars are the largest in the solar system, capable of blanketing the entire red
                planet and lasting for months. One theory as to why dust storms can grow so big on Mars starts with
                airborne dust particles absorbing sunlight, warming the Martian atmosphere in their vicinity. Warm
                pockets of air flow toward colder regions, generating winds. Strong winds lift more dust off the ground,
                which in turn heats the atmosphere, raising more wind and kicking up more dust.
