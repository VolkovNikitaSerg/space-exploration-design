                    Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. Fittingly, it was named after the king of the
                    gods in Roman mythology. In a similar manner, the ancient Greeks named the planet after Zeus, the
                    king of the Greek pantheon.

                    Jupiter helped revolutionize the way we saw the universe and ourselves in 1610, when Galileo
                    discovered Jupiter's four large moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, now known as the Galilean
                    moons. This was the first time that celestial bodies were seen circling an object other than Earth,
                    major support of the Copernican view that Earth was not the center of the universe.

                Jupiter is the most massive planet in our solar system, more than twice as massive as all the other
                planets combined, and had it been about 80 times more massive, it would have actually become a star
                instead of a planet. Its atmosphere resembles that of the sun, made up mostly of hydrogen and helium,
                and with four large moons and many smaller moons in orbit around it, Jupiter by itself forms a kind of
                miniature solar system. All told, the immense volume of Jupiter could hold more than 1,300 Earths.

            <p class="text-content">
                The colorful bands of Jupiter are arranged in dark belts and light zones created by strong east-west
                winds in the planet's upper atmosphere traveling more than 400 mph (640 km/h). The white clouds in the
                zones are made of crystals of frozen ammonia, while darker clouds of other chemicals are found in the
                belts. At the deepest visible levels are blue clouds. Far from being static, the stripes of clouds
                change over time. Inside the atmosphere, diamond rain may fill the skies.

            <p class="text-content">
                The most extraordinary feature on Jupiter is undoubtedly the Great Red Spot, a giant hurricane-like
                storm seen for more than 300 years. At its widest, the Great Red Spot is three times the diameter of the
                Earth, and its edge spins counterclockwise around its center at a speed of about 225 mph (360 km/h). The
                color of the storm, which usually varies from brick red to slightly brown, may come from small amounts
                of sulfur and phosphorus in the ammonia crystals in Jupiter's clouds. grows and shrinks. The spot has
                been shrinking for quite some time, although the rate may be slowing in recent years.

            <p class="text-content">
                Jupiter's gargantuan magnetic field is the strongest of all the planets in the solar system at nearly
                20,000 times the strength of Earth's. It traps electrically charged particles in an intense belt of
                electrons and other electrically charged particles that regularly blasts the planet's moons and rings
                with a level of radiation more than 1,000 times the lethal level for a human, damaging even heavily
                shielded spacecraft such as NASA's Galileo probe. The magnetosphere of Jupiter, which is composed of
                these fields and particles, swells out some 600,000 to 2 million miles (1 million to 3 million km)
                toward the sun and tapers to a tail extending more than 600 million miles (1 billion km) behind Jupiter.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Jupiter spins faster than any other planet, taking a little under 10 hours to complete a turn on its
                axis, compared with 24 hours for Earth. This rapid spin makes Jupiter bulge at the equator and flatten
                at the poles, making the planet about 7 percent wider at the equator than at the poles.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Jupiter broadcasts radio waves strong enough to detect on Earth. These come in two forms — strong bursts
                that occur when Io, the closest of Jupiter's large moons, passes through certain regions of Jupiter's
                magnetic field, and continuous radiation from Jupiter's surface and high-energy particles in its
                radiation belts. These radio waves could help scientists to probe the oceans on its moons.

                Jupiter's three rings came as a surprise when NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft discovered them around the
                planet's equator in 1979. Each are much fainter than Saturn's rings.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                The main ring is flattened. It is about 20 miles (30 km) thick and more than 4,000 miles (6,400 km)
                wide.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                The inner cloud-like ring, called the halo, is roughly 12,000 miles (20,000 km) thick. The halo extends
                halfway from the main ring down to the planet's cloud tops and expands by interaction with Jupiter's
                magnetic field. Both the main ring and halo are composed of small, dark particles.

            <p class="text-content">
                The third ring, known as the gossamer ring because of its transparency, is actually three rings of
                microscopic debris from three of Jupiter's moons, Amalthea, Thebe and Adrastea. It is probably made up
                of dust particles less than 10 microns in diameter, about the same size of the particles found in
                cigarette smoke, and extends to an outer edge of about 80,000 miles (129,000 km) from the center of the
                planet and inward to about 18,600 miles (30,000 km).

                Ripples in the rings of both Jupiter and Saturn may be signs of impacts from comets and asteroids.
