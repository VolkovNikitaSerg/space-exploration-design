                    Venus, the second planet from the sun, is named for the Roman goddess of love and beauty. The planet
                    — the only planet named after a female — may have been named for the most beautiful deity of her
                    pantheon because it shone the brightest of the five planets known to ancient astronomers.

                <p class="text-content">
                    In ancient times, Venus was often thought to be two different stars, the evening star and the
                    morning star — that is, the ones that first appeared at sunset and sunrise. In Latin, they were
                    respectively known as Vesper and Lucifer. In Christian times, Lucifer, or "light-bringer," became
                    known as the name of Satan before his fall. However, further observations of Venus in the space age
                    show a very hellish environment. This makes Venus a very difficult planet to observe from up close,
                    because spacecraft do not survive long on its surface

                Venus is the hottest world in the solar system. Although Venus is not the planet closest to the sun, its
                dense atmosphere traps heat in a runaway version of the greenhouse effect that warms Earth. As a result,
                temperatures on Venus reach 870 degrees Fahrenheit (465 degrees Celsius), more than hot enough to melt
                lead. Probes that scientists have landed there have survived only a few hours before being destroyed.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Venus has a hellish atmosphere as well, consisting mainly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric
                acid, and scientists have only detected trace amounts of water in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is
                heavier than that of any other planet, leading to a surface pressure 90 times that of Earth. Incredibly,
                however, early in Venus' history the planet may have been habitable, according to models from NASA
                researchers at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                The surface of Venus is extremely dry. During its evolution, ultraviolet rays from the sun evaporated
                water quickly, keeping it in a prolonged molten state. There is no liquid water on its surface today
                because the scorching heat created by its ozone-filled atmosphere would cause any to boil away. Roughly
                two-thirds of the Venusian surface is covered by flat, smooth plains that are marred by thousands of
                volcanoes, some which are still active today, ranging from about 0.5 to 150 miles (0.8 to 240
                kilometers) wide, with lava flows carving long, winding canals up to more than 3,000 miles (5,000 km) in
                length, longer than on any other planet.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Six mountainous regions make up about one-third of the Venusian surface. One mountain range, called
                Maxwell, is about 540 miles (870 km) long and reaches up to some 7 miles (11.3 km) high, making it the
                highest feature on the planet
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Venus also possesses a number of surface features unlike anything on Earth. For example, Venus has
                coronae, or crowns — ring-like structures that range from roughly 95 to 360 miles (155 to 580 km) wide.
                Scientists believe these formed when hot material beneath the crust rises up, warping the planet's
                surface. Venus also has tesserae, or tiles — raised areas in which many ridges and valleys have formed
                in different directions.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                With conditions on Venus that could be described as infernal, the ancient name for Venus — Lucifer —
                seems to fit. However, this name did not carry any fiendish connotations; Lucifer means "light-bringer,"
                and when seen from Earth, Venus is brighter than any other planet or even any star in the night sky
                because of its highly reflective clouds and its closeness to our planet.

                If viewed from above, Venus rotates on its axis the opposite way that most planets rotate. That means on
                Venus, the sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east. On Earth, the sun appears to rise
                in the east and set in the west.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                The Venusian year — the time it takes to orbit the sun — is about 225 Earth-days long. Normally, that
                would mean that days on Venus would be longer than years. However, because of Venus' curious retrograde
                rotation, the time from one sunrise to the next is only about 117 Earth-days long. [Gallery: Transit of
                Venus from June 5, 2012, when the planet transited in front of the sun for the last time until the year
                2117.

            <p class="text-content">
                The very top layer of Venus' clouds zip around the planet every four Earth-days, propelled by
                hurricane-force winds traveling roughly 224 mph (360 kph). This super-rotation of the planet's
                atmosphere, some 60 times faster than Venus itself rotates, may be one of Venus' biggest mysteries. The
                winds at the planet's surface are much slower, estimated to be just a few miles per hour.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                The Venus Express spacecraft, a European Space Agency mission that operated between 2005 and 2014,
                intriguingly found evidence of lightning on the planet. This lightning is unique from that found on the
                other planets in the solar system, in that it is not associated with water clouds. Instead, on Venus,
                the lightning is associated with clouds of sulfuric acid. Scientists are excited by these electrical
                discharges, because they can break molecules into fragments that can then combine with other fragments
                in unexpected ways.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                A long-lived cyclone on Venus, first observed in 2006, was observed in constant flux, with elements
                constantly breaking apart and reforming. The clouds also carry signs of meteorological events known as
                gravity waves, caused when winds blow over geological features, causing rises and falls in the layers of
                air.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Unusual stripes in the upper clouds of Venus are dubbed "blue absorbers" or "ultraviolet absorbers"
                because they strongly absorb light in the blue and ultraviolet wavelengths. These are soaking up a huge
                amount of energy — nearly half of the total solar energy the planet absorbs. As such, they seem to play
                a major role in keeping Venus as hellish as it is. Their exact composition remains uncertain; some
                scientists suggest it could even be life, although many things would need to be ruled out before
                accepting that conclusion.
