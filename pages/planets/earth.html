                    to
                    have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of liquid water on its surface, and, of course,
                    life.
                </p>
                <p class="text-content"> Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system — smaller
                    than the
                    four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranusand Neptune, but larger than the three other rocky
                    planets,
                    Mercury, Marsand Venus.</p>
                <p class="text-content">Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers), and is
                    round
                    because gravity pulls matter into a ball, although it is not perfectly round, instead being more
                    of an
                    "oblate spheroid" whose spin causes it to be squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator.

            <p class="text-content">Earth spins on an imaginary line called an axis that runs from the North Pole to the
                South Pole, while also orbiting the sun. It takes Earth 23.439 hours to complete a rotation on its axis,
                and roughly 365.26 days to complete an orbit around the sun.</p>
            <p class="text-content">Earth's axis of rotation is tilted in relation to the ecliptic plane, an imaginary
                surface through Earth's orbit around the sun. This means the northern and southern hemispheres will
                sometimes point toward or away from the sun depending on the time of year, varying the amount of light
                they receive and causing the seasons.</p>
            <p class="text-content">Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle, but is rather an oval-shaped ellipse, like
                that of the orbits of all the other planets. Earth is a bit closer to the sun in early January and
                farther away in July, although this variation has a much smaller effect than the heating and cooling
                caused by the tilt of Earth's axis. Earth happens to lie within the so-called "Goldilocks zone" around
                its star, where temperatures are just right to maintain liquid water on its surface.</p>

                Earth's atmosphere is roughly 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, with trace amounts of water,
                argon, carbon dioxide and other gases. Nowhere else in the solar system can one find an atmosphere
                loaded with free oxygen, which ultimately proved vital to one of the other unique features of Earth —
                us.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Air surrounds Earth and becomes thinner farther from the surface. Roughly 100 miles (160 km) above
                Earth, the air is so thin that satellites can zip through with little resistance. Still, traces of
                atmosphere can be found as high as 370 miles (600 km) above the surface.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                The lowest layer of the atmosphere is known as the troposphere, which is constantly in motion, causing
                the weather. Sunlight heats the planet's surface, causing warm air to rise. This air ultimately expands
                and cools as air pressure decreases, and because this cool air is denser than its surroundings, it then
                sinks, only to get warmed by the Earth once again.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Above the troposphere, some 30 miles (48 km) above the Earth's surface, is the stratosphere. The still
                air of the stratosphere contains the ozone layer, which was created when ultraviolet light caused trios
                of oxygen atoms to bind together into ozone molecules. Ozone prevents most of the sun's harmful
                ultraviolet radiation from reaching Earth's surface.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Water vapor, carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun, warming Earth.
                Without this so-called "greenhouse effect," Earth would probably be too cold for life to exist, although
                a runaway greenhouse effect led to the hellish conditions now seen on Venus.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Earth-orbiting satellites have shown that the upper atmosphere actually expands during the day and
                contracts at night due to heating and cooling.
