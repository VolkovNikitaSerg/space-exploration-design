            The Pluto

                    Pluto, once considered the ninth and most distant planet from the sun, is now the largest known
                    dwarf planet in the solar system. It is also one of the largest known members of the Kuiper Belt, a
                    shadowy zone beyond the orbit of Neptune thought to be populated by hundreds of thousands of rocky,
                    icy bodies each larger than 62 miles (100 kilometers) across, along with 1 trillion or more comets.

                <p class="text-content">
                    In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet, a change widely thought of as a demotion. The
                    question of Pluto's planet status has attracted controversy and stirred debate in the scientific
                    community, and among the general public, since then. In 2017, a science group (including members of
                    the New Horizon mission) proposed a new definition of planethood based on "round objects in space
                    smaller than stars," which would make the number of planets in our solar system expand from 8 to
                    roughly 100.

                Pluto's highly elliptical orbit can take it more than 49 times as far out from the sun as Earth. Since
                the dwarf planet's orbit is so eccentric, or far from circular, Pluto's distance from the sun can vary
                considerably. The dwarf planet actually gets closer to the sun than Neptune is for 20 years out of
                Pluto's 248-Earth-years-long orbit, providing astronomers a rare chance to study this small, cold,
                distant world.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                As a result of that orbit, after 20 years as the eighth planet (in order going out from the sun), in
                1999, Pluto crossed Neptune's orbit to become the farthest planet from the sun (until it was demoted to
                the status of dwarf planet).
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                When Pluto is closer to the sun, its surface ices thaw and temporarily form a thin atmosphere,
                consisting mostly of nitrogen, with some methane. Pluto's low gravity, which is a little more than
                one-twentieth that of Earth's, causes this atmosphere to extend much higher in altitude than Earth's.
                When traveling farther away from the sun, most of Pluto's atmosphere is thought to freeze and all but
                disappear. Still, in the time that it does have an atmosphere, Pluto can apparently experience strong
                winds. The atmosphere also has brightness variations that could be explained by gravity waves, or air
                flowing over mountains
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                While Pluto's atmosphere is too thin to allow liquids to flow today, they may have streamed along the
                surface in the ancient past. New Horizons imaged a frozen lake in Tombaugh Regio that appeared to have
                ancient channels nearby. At some point in the ancient past, the planet could have had an atmosphere
                roughly 40 times thicker than on Mars.

            Pluto's moons
        </h2>

        <section>
            <p class="text-content">
                Pluto has five moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra, with Charon being the closest to Pluto and
                Hydra the most distant.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                In 1978, astronomers discovered that Pluto had a very large moon nearly half the dwarf planet's own
                size. This moon was dubbed Charon, after the mythological demon who ferried souls to the underworld in
                Greek mythology.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Because Charon and Pluto are so similar in size, their orbit is unlike that of most planets and their
                moons. Both Pluto and Charon orbit a point in space that lies between them, similar to the orbits of
                binary star systems, For this reason, scientists refer to Pluto and Charon as a double dwarf planet,
                double planet or binary system.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                Pluto and Charon are just 12,200 miles (19,640 km) apart, less than the distance by flight between
                London and Sydney. Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 6.4 Earth-days, and one Pluto rotation — a
                Pluto-day — also takes 6.4 Earth-days. This is because Charon hovers over the same spot on Pluto's
                surface, and the same side of Charon always faces Pluto, a phenomenon known as tidal locking.
