                    The sun lies at the heart of the solar system, where it is by far the largest object. It holds 99.8
                    percent of the solar system's mass and is roughly 109 times the diameter of the Earth — about one
                    million Earths could fit inside the sun
                </p>

                <p class="text-content">
                    The visible part of the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius), while
                    temperatures in the core reach more than 27 million F (15 million C), driven by nuclear reactions.
                    One would need to explode 100 billion tons of dynamite every second to match the energy produced by
                    the sun, according to NASA.

                    The sun is one of more than 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. It orbits some 25,000 light-years
                    from the galactic core, completing a revolution once every 250 million years or so. The sun is
                    relatively young, part of a generation of stars known as Population I, which are relatively rich in
                    elements heavier than helium. An older generation of stars is called Population II, and an earlier
                    generation of Population III may have existed, although no members of this generation are known yet.

            Formation and evolution
        </h2>

        <section>

            <p class="text-content">
                The sun was born about 4.6 billion years ago. Many scientists think the sun and the rest of the solar
                system formed from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula. As the nebula
                collapsed because of its gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was
                pulled toward the center to form the sun.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                The sun has enough nuclear fuel to stay much as it is now for another 5 billion years. After that, it
                will swell to become a red giant. Eventually, it will shed its outer layers, and the remaining core will
                collapse to become a white dwarf. Slowly, this will fade, to enter its final phase as a dim, cool
                theoretical object sometimes known as a black dwarf.

            Internal structure and atmosphere
        </h2>

        <section>
            <p class="text-content">
                The sun and its atmosphere are divided into several zones and layers. The solar interior, from the
                inside out, is made up of the core, radiative zone and the convective zone. The solar atmosphere above
                that consists of the photosphere, chromosphere, a transition region and the corona. Beyond that is the
                solar wind, an outflow of gas from the corona.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                The core extends from the sun's center to about a quarter of the way to its surface. Although it only
                makes up roughly 2 percent of the sun's volume, it is almost 15 times the density of lead and holds
                nearly half of the sun's mass. Next is the radiative zone, which extends from the core to 70 percent of
                the way to the sun's surface, making up 32 percent of the sun's volume and 48 percent of its mass. Light
                from the core gets scattered in this zone, so tha a single photon often may take a million years to pass
                through.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                The convection zone reaches up to the sun's surface, and makes up 66 percent of the sun's volume but
                only a little more than 2 percent of its mass. Roiling "convection cells" of gas dominate this zone. Two
                main kinds of solar convection cells exist — granulation cells about 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) wide
                and supergranulation cells about 20,000 miles (30,000 km) in diameter.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                The photosphere is the lowest layer of the sun's atmosphere, and emits the light we see. It is about 300
                miles (500 km) thick, although most of the light comes from its lowest third. Temperatures in the
                photosphere range from 11,000 F (6,125 C) at bottom to 7,460 F (4,125 C) at top. Next up is the
                chromosphere, which is hotter, up to 35,500 F (19,725 C), and is apparently made up entirely of spiky
                structures known as spicules typically some 600 miles (1,000 km) across and up to 6,000 miles (10,000
                km) high.
            </p>

            <p class="text-content">
                After that is the transition region a few hundred to a few thousand miles thick, which is heated by the
                corona above it and sheds most of its light as ultraviolet rays. At the top is the super-hot corona,
                which is made of structures such as loops and streams of ionized gas. The corona generally ranges from
                900,000 F (500,000 C) to 10.8 million F (6 million C) and can even reach tens of millions of degrees
                when a solar flare occurs. Matter from the corona is blown off as the solar wind.

            Magnetic field
        </h2>

        <section>
            <p class="text-content">
                The strength of the sun's magnetic field is typically only about twice as strong as Earth's field.
                However, it becomes highly concentrated in small areas, reaching up to 3,000 times stronger than usual.
                These kinks and twists in the magnetic field develop because the sun spins more rapidly at the equator
                than at the higher latitudes and because the inner parts of the sun rotate more quickly than the
                surface. These distortions create features ranging from sunspots to spectacular eruptions known as
                flares and coronal mass ejections. Flares are the most violent eruptions in the solar system, while
                coronal mass ejections are less violent but involve extraordinary amounts of matter — a single ejection
                can spout roughly 20 billion tons (18 billion metric tons) of matter into space.

        <section>
            <p class="text-content">
                Just like most other stars, the sun is made up mostly of hydrogen, followed by helium. Nearly all the
                remaining matter consists of seven other elements — oxygen, carbon, neon, nitrogen, magnesium, iron and
                silicon. For every 1 million atoms of hydrogen in the sun, there are 98,000 of helium, 850 of oxygen,
                360 of carbon, 120 of neon, 110 of nitrogen, 40 of magnesium, 35 of iron and 35 of silicon. Still,
                hydrogen is the lightest of all elements, so it only accounts for roughly 72 percent of the sun's mass,
                while helium makes up about 26 percent.
